# Introduction

As the population of the Bangladesh continues to grow, so too does the need for healthcare services and options. The current population of Bangladesh is 165.37 million as of Friday, December 1, 2017, based on the latest United Nations estimates and it will increase to 185.10 million by the end of 2020. This, in turn, will result in a swell in the number of patients seeking care at medical facilities, hospitals, wellness centers and physicians’ practices.

# Motivation
The number of internet users is increasing rapidly in Bangladesh. According to latest reports, there are 106 million active mobile phone subscribers in Bangladesh by 2016. As a rough estimate, we can assume that there are around 10 million smartphone users in Bangladesh. And the double amount of people will be using internet in their daily life. So with Medi Assistant younger patients and clients may have an easy transition, as this group is typically Internet savvy and actually prefer to get the information online as this internet based service will provide them the information of hospitals, pharmacy, doctor’s information, doctor appointments, emergency numbers like fire-service, police etc in one place, just a click away! This will not only save the time of the user but also save them from the harassment they would suffer.

# Conclusion
As we can see making an appointment also save time for patients, as they no longer have to commit a part of their busy schedule to calling their medical, healthcare or wellness provider. Staff spends less time on the phone booking and managing appointments, thereby freeing up their schedule for more important and pressing tasks. While common in some office settings, scheduling appointments over the phone is a time and resource draining process that’s also inconvenient for patients, especially in our web connected society where more and more individuals prefer to conduct common tasks such as scheduling appointments online instead of picking up the phone and calling them in.
